Munyn is a desktop application for creating visual maps of computer networks and security assessments. It functions as a digital whiteboard where you can drag and drop nodes to represent various components of a network and the relationships between them.

## Core Features

*   **Visual Mapping:** Create diagrams by adding and connecting nodes for things like networks, hosts, users, and services.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Organize your maps using "contexts." This allows you to nest diagrams within nodes to represent more complex relationships, such as the services running on a particular host.
*   **Save and Load:** Your maps are saved as JSON files, so you can easily store and share them.
*   **Node Properties:** Add custom properties to nodes to store additional information.

## What it's for

Munyn is useful for tasks like:

*   Mapping out a network during a penetration test.
*   Visualizing the components of a home lab or corporate network.
*   Creating a visual representation of an attack path for a report.

The main goal of Munyn is to provide a simple, visual way to document and explore network structures and security-related information.
