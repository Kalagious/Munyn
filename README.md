# Munyn: Your Visual Cybersecurity Storyteller

Ever tried explaining a complex network intrusion to a client, or mapping out a penetration test on a cluttered whiteboard? It can be tough. That's where Munyn comes in.

Think of Munyn as your digital canvas for cybersecurity. It’s a tool that helps you visually map out network infrastructures, trace potential attack paths, and tell the story of a security assessment in a way that’s clear, concise, and easy to understand.

## What's Munyn all about?

Munyn is built on a simple idea: that visualizing complex security concepts makes them easier to understand. With Munyn, you can:

*   **Bring your networks to life:** Go beyond simple diagrams. Build rich, visual representations of your target environments by dragging and dropping nodes for everything from servers and workstations to users and services.
*   **Uncover the path of an attack:** Connect the dots between vulnerabilities, exploits, and user accounts to create a visual narrative of how an attacker could compromise a system. It's a powerful way to understand and communicate risk.
*   **Keep your thoughts organized:** Dive deep into specific parts of your network without losing the bigger picture. Munyn's "contexts" let you create nested diagrams, so you can explore a single host or an entire subnet with ease.
*   **Share your insights:** Save your work as a simple JSON file, making it a breeze to share your findings with colleagues, clients, or anyone who needs to understand the security landscape.

Whether you're a seasoned penetration tester, a security analyst trying to make sense of a complex network, or a sysadmin who wants a better way to visualize your infrastructure, Munyn is for you. It's a tool for anyone who believes that a good picture is worth a thousand lines of code.
