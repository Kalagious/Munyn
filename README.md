# Munyn

Munyn is a flexible and intuitive visual mapping tool designed for security professionals. Think of it as a dynamic, digital whiteboard that helps you chart out complex network infrastructures, identify potential attack vectors, and visualize entire penetration testing workflows.

## What is Munyn?

With Munyn, you can:

*   **Quickly build network diagrams:** Drag and drop pre-defined nodes for networks, hosts, users, and services to create a visual representation of your target environment.
*   **Map out attack paths:** Visually link vulnerabilities, exploits, and user accounts to understand and demonstrate how an attacker could move through a network.
*   **Stay organized:** Use "contexts" to create nested diagrams, allowing you to zoom in on specific networks or hosts without losing the big picture.
*   **Save and share your work:** Your graphs are saved in a simple JSON format, making it easy to store, share, and collaborate with your team.

Whether you're a penetration tester, a security analyst, or a systems administrator, Munyn provides a clear and powerful way to visualize and understand your security landscape.

## Features

*   **Node-Based Graphing:** Drag and drop various node types to build your diagrams.
*   **Contexts:** Nest diagrams within nodes to manage complexity.
*   **Connections:** Draw lines between nodes to represent relationships.
*   **Save/Load:** Save your work to a JSON file and load it back in later.
*   **Customization:** Add properties and apply themes to nodes.

## How to Use

1.  **Adding Nodes:** Drag nodes from the trays on the left onto the canvas.
2.  **Creating Connections:** Select the "Path Tool" and click and drag from one node to another.
3.  **Navigating Contexts:** Double-click on a node to enter its context. Use the breadcrumb trail at the top to navigate back.
4.  **Saving and Loading:** Use the "Save" and "Load" buttons in the top menu to manage your work.
